We use the socket functions in our application:
* socket() -> receive a host and a door
* close() -> Mark the socket closed
* listen() -> Enable a server to accept connections
* accept() -> Accept a connection
* bind() -> Bind the socket to address
* recv() -> Receive data from the socket
* connect() -> Connect to a remote socket at address

Here is the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) about python3 with socket
